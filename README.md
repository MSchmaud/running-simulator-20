# Running-Simulator-20
My first attempt at a somewhat-legitimate game in Java. This was used as my final project in my AP Computer Science A class in high school.

# General Info
- I have not included any assets in this repo, although I would estimate that I created between 50-80 sprites for this game
- The coolest aspect of this project in my opinion is the ability to customize maps completely
- It is called Running Simulator 20 as it is a sequel to a game I wrote in Python the year prior: Running Simulator

# The Good Stuff
- The overall structure is very optimized for further additions and improvements
- It was my largest project at the time by far, with 55ish classes total
- I really enjoyed writing the more challenging parts of the game such as the map loader (creates a map based off numbers in a .txt file) and entity pathfinding

# The Bad Stuff
- Very poorly commented (to be fair I had to spend most of my time writing the code)
- The way I got my resources into the game was awful and I still cannot look at it
- May be some features hidden in the code that never got finished (I was a full-time high school student and athlete at the time)
